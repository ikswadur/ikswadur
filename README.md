👋 Hi, I’m @ikswadur  
🌍 I’m interested in building useful, minimal, and open tech for real-world problems  
💡 I’m currently learning Rust 🦀 and diving deeper into backend architecture  
🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source tools, API design, and developer-first platforms  
📫 How to reach me: [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcin-tomasz-rudawski-b4b33441/) | [biuro@energobroker.org]
